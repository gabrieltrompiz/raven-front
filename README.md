## About this project

This project was developed for Software Engineering II subject, in 2018. The goal was to create any app from scratch, which involved going through the analysis of the software requirements; defining the architecture, components and characteristics of the system; the implementation and development of the app and the testing and quality assurance of the final product.

It's a mobile app that allows the users to communicate in real-time, and would be available for any platform since it was developed using React Native. 

## Tech Stack

* React Native with TypeScript
* Redux
* Socket.IO Client

## To-do

Unfortunately this app could not be finished since that semester was known because there were a lot of riots across the campus of the university and most subjects had to be suspended.

The features that are missing in the app are basically all related to the user settings and might be implemented in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Serves the app that can be opened using the Expo app.

### `npm run ios` or `yarn run ios`
Builds the app and opens it in a Simulator or physical device running iOS.

### `npm run android` or `yarn run android`
Builds the app and opens it in a Android Emulator or physical device running Android.
